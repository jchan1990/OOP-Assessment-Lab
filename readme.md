## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This should be done independently._

The goal of this lab is to test your knowledge of Object Oriented Programming concepts and to make sure you know how to implement them.  

There are two main components:

1. A written section, with both open-ended and multiple choice questions
2. A programming section

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Write your answers to each each question in the [oop_questions.txt](oop_questions.txt) file
- Complete the TODO items from the Java project in the [starter-code](starter-code) folder

#### Starter code

The starter code contains a Java program that is the beginning of a role playing game! It has a Main class, Monster class, Zombie class, and Dragon class. You must go through each file and complete all of the TODO items.

#### Deliverable

Answer the questions in the [oop_questions.txt](oop_questions.txt) and complete the code as per the requirements list in the [starter-code](starter-code).

When you run the code, the output should look like this:

```
I am a Dragon with 3 health and do 8 damage!
I am a Zombie with 4 health and do 10 damage!
```
