1. Describe the difference between a Class and an Object.
The difference between a Class and an Object is that a class is basically a
blueprint. The blueprint describes the properties and foundations of the object.
An object on the other-hand is an instance of a class, it is a static piece of
code that consists of attributes which don't change during the execution of a
program

2. What keyword do you use to turn a normal Class into a Subclass? (choose one)
  b. extends

3. Describe the difference between public and private?
Public means that it's accessible by all and the values can be manipulated by
anyone. Private on the other-hand is only accessible and visible only to their
Class

4. Can a subclass access a private method of its parent class? (choose one)
  b. No


5. Define the term constructor.
A constructor creates an instance of an object

6. Can you access a static method of a class without making an instance of it? (choose one)
  a. Yes

7. Describe the purpose of overriding a method.
The purpose of overriding a method allows you to change how to react when the
method is called on by a subclass since a child class may not necessarily
react in the same way as the parent
